README:

1. To Build both Toolchain and Firmware image: 
   1.1 Host Ubuntu 12.04 or higher (Linux kernel 3.2.0) on x86 machine
   1.2 Compiling tool version: gcc 4.6.3 or higher, GNU Make version 3.81

2. Put the package GPL_PACKAGE_NAME.tar.gz to a directory such as /home/TP-LINK, then extract the compressed files.
   $ cd /home/TP-LINK
   $ tar xzvf GPL_PACKAGE_NAME.tar.gz

To Build Firmware image:
   1.1 Go to GPL_PACKAGE_NAME build folder and execute make.
   $ cd /home/TP-LINK/GPL_PACKAGE_NAME/build
   Do as:

	1. sudo make  env_build

	2. make boot_build
	
	3. make  kernel_build(kernel_menuconfig)
	
	4. make  modules_build
		4.1 "modules_build" include some sub target,like kernel_modules,misc_modules,wlan_modules...
		4.2 For most people only need to make kernel_modules 
	
	5. make apps_build

	6. make fs_build
	
	7. make image_build

   will generate the DEV_NAME_(xxx).bin, under GPL_PACKAGE_NAME/targets/image_MODEL folder. 
   xxx refers to flash or up_boot, with specific time-stamp and version info.
